# Traffic-Light-Detection-and-Classification-using-deep-CNN
The main objective here was to detect the given images for presence of traffic lights and then classify its type if present i.e. red, green or amber. 

## WE used a pretrained YOLOV5 model via transfer learning to create a multi image classification model
Annotated more than 700 images to create a custom dataset.
